# Advent Of Code 2023
This is my solution for Advent Of Code 2023. My solutions are written in Go. Each day I will have test cases set up for each sample input the prompt provides and full input files in the `inputs` directory.

## Usage
To run any solution execute `go run ./main.go`. There are flags set up to select a day and part:

* -day, --day - This flag allows you to select with day's solution to run
* -part, --part - This flag allows you to select which part of that day's solution to run
* -h, --help - This flag will display a simple help text

Test can be run with `go test ./...`. This will run all tests. Alternatively you can specify a test to run with the `-run=TestName` flag
